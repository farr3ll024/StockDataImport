### Progress

- Added "cycles" to the process and rearranged some code to center around 'cycle.'
- A cycle is a single run of the import process.
- Now, a "cycles" directory will be created and a directory with the specific 'cycle id' will be created.
- This directory contains a 'log.txt' file that contains a log of all events.
- This directory also contains files for all requests to and responses from the eodhistoricaldata.com API.
- Removed "Fixes" - going to take a different approach to discovering which stocks have options.
